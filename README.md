# Alchitry AU Shields
### Aditya Sehgal

</p>This repo is a compilation of custom shields I have designed for the Alchitry AU FPGA.</br>
The following is a list of shields I have designed:</p>
  <il>
   
 - [Alchitry PCB Template : ](https://github.com/adsehgal/Alchitry_AU/tree/master/KiCad_Template_Alchitry_Base_Top_Bot) KiCad template for the FPGA board, provided by Alchitry

 - [I/O Shield with HDMI : ](https://github.com/adsehgal/Alchitry_AU/tree/master/IO_Shield_W_HDMI) I/O shield with a variety of peripherals including an LED matrix and HDMI. Uses original Alchitry connectors
 - [Play Shield : ](https://github.com/adsehgal/Alchitry_AU/tree/master/Alchitry_Play_Shield) Shield designed to work like a controller with two sets of directional arrow keys, 7-segment displays, LED array and HDMI.

 The following is a list of boards I designed with a 1mm pitch connector instead of the original connectors that Alchitry uses:
  - [Connector Adaptor :](https://github.com/adsehgal/Alchitry_AU/tree/master/Alchitry_AU_Connector_Adaptor) Adaptor board to convert the 0.5mm standard mezzanine connectors to 1mm pitch connectors
 - [I/O Shield with 1mm connectors :](https://github.com/adsehgal/Alchitry_AU/tree/master/Alchitry_AU_NonStandard_IO) I/O shield with a variety of peripherals, used in conjunction with ["Connector Adaptor PCB"](https://github.com/adsehgal/Alchitry_AU/tree/master/Alchitry_AU_Connector_Adaptor)
