# Alchitry_AU_BreakoutV2
Breakout Board designed to be used with the Alchitry AU FPGA in conjunction with the mezzanine adaptor dersigned by me.
The breakout board has 5x tacticle buttons, 8x LEDs, 4x DIP switches, 2x 2-Digit 7 segment displays, extra breakout pins from Bank B as well as pin headers for the HDMI adaptor designed by 1bit-squared.

Goal of this breakout board is to offer similar functionality as the one offered by Alchitry in addition to HDMI output and extra headers if needed.

Note: the HDMI headers can be used as regular I/O as well.
